# Arnacon - Blockchain-based Telecommunication App

Welcome to **Arnacon**, a decentralized telecommunication app that leverages blockchain technology for secure and efficient communication. This application offers seamless integration with **Telegram**, support for payments via **Ton blockchain**, and various other features, enabling enhanced security, privacy, and functionality in communication.

## Features

### 1. Telegram Account Bot Verifier
- Weâ€™ve added a **Telegram Bot Verifier** to authenticate Telegram accounts within the app.
- This enables users to **verify their identity** securely using their Telegram account for further interactions on the platform.
  
### 2. Call Support via Telegram and Emails (Android)
- Users can now initiate voice calls to other verified Telegram accounts, directly from within the app.
- **Email integration**: Users can also make calls to email-linked accounts (currently supported on **Android**).
- Ensures seamless connectivity between contacts via Telegram and email.

### 3. Payment Support with Ton Blockchain via TonKeeper
- **Ton blockchain integration** is now enabled for secure payment transactions.
- Payment processing happens via the **TonKeeper app**, ensuring decentralized and secure handling of funds.
- This feature makes the platform useful for both communication and financial transactions, all within the secure Ton blockchain environment.

### 4. Transaction Confirmation and Verifier
- Every transaction processed via Ton blockchain comes with **transaction confirmation**.
- The app also includes a **transaction verifier** that ensures every payment is correctly validated and securely recorded on the blockchain.

### 5. Working Process Overview
- **Telegram Identity Verification**: Users verify their Telegram identity using the Telegram bot integrated into the app.
- **Making Calls**: Once the userâ€™s Telegram account is verified, they can initiate voice calls to any other Telegram-verified user or email-linked contact on Android.
- **Payments**: Users can make payments for services using Ton blockchain via TonKeeper. The transaction details are confirmed in-app.
